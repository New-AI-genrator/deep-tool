# Aetherium Nexus — Content Strategy & Curation Guidelines

Voice & Tone
- Authoritative minimalism; precise, evidence-led; never hype
- Headlines: bold and crisp; body: calm confidence; data: exact

Curation Principles
- Inclusion criteria: usefulness, reliability, security, momentum
- Verification: official site, docs, changelogs, third-party footprints
- Freshness: track releases, pricing changes, outages
- Balance: enterprise, indie, open source; avoid vendor bias

Listing Structure (per tool)
- Identity: name, logo, founding year, HQ, valuation/funding status
- Essentials: website, pricing tier, API status, integrations, mobile support
- Technical: architecture, data, compute, privacy, environmental impact
- Expert Guidance: Best For (5–7 use cases), Consider If, Limitations, Roadmap
- Community Intelligence: ratings aggregate, enterprise adoption, citations, sentiment

Writing Standards
- One-sentence value proposition first; then details in scannable bullets
- Avoid adjectives unless benchmarked; use numbers, links, proof
- Length per section: Identity (short), Essentials (compact), Technical (concise), Guidance (specific), Community (summarized)

Review Workflow
- Draft → Peer Review → Verification → Publish → Monitor
- Weekly curator sweeps; automated alerts for changes

Ethics
- Disclose partnerships; separate editorial from sponsorships
- Respect user privacy; anonymize sensitive data
