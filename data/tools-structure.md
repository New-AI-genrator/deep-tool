# Tools Data Structure Proposal

## Current Issues
1. Single massive file (tools.ts) with 17,000+ lines
2. Performance degradation when adding more tools
3. Difficult to maintain and update

## Proposed Solution
Split tools data into multiple files by category for better performance:

```
data/
├── tools/
│   ├── creative-design.ts
│   ├── productivity-business.ts
│   ├── development-engineering.ts
│   ├── marketing-growth.ts
│   ├── research-science.ts
│   └── ... (other categories)
├── tools-index.ts (exports all categories)
└── tools.ts (main file - backwards compatibility)
```

## Benefits
1. Faster read/write operations on individual files
2. Easier to maintain specific categories
3. Better collaboration (multiple people can work on different files)
4. Improved build times
5. More scalable for 10,000+ tools

## Implementation Plan
1. Split current tools.ts into category files
2. Create tools-index.ts to export all categories
3. Update imports in the application
4. Maintain backwards compatibility
